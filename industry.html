        <h2 class="blog-post-title">RingConn: Smart Health Monitoring Ring</h2>
        July 2021 - Now <br>
        I am the CTO and co-founder of Guangdong Jiuzhi Technology Co., Ltd since established in 2021. In Jiuzhi, I leads the techology & product department including six teams: product and project management, application development, hardware design, website development, algorithm implementation, and R&D research. <br>
        RingConn Smart Ring is the first commercial wearable device that our company has released. RingConn is developed as a world-class smart health monitoring ring, which is equipped by low-power electronic design, accurate algorithms, user-friendly application, and health-care system. All of the technologies are developed by our company, and we own the whole intellectual property. <br>
        We used 17 months to develop and manufacture the brand-new smart ring, and RingConn was firstly sold as a crowdfunding project in INDIEGOGO. Owning to the excellent product and customer services, we have sold more than 8,000 devices with a value above 1.2million USD in 50 days. <br>
        The key features of RingConn are introduced as follows. 
        <li><b>Health Indicators.</b> Based on the PPG sensors and accelerometers, we have implemented some key algorithms for physiological indicators, such as heart rate, heart rate variability, oxygen saturation, step counting, and respiratory rate. </li>
        <li><b>Sleep Tracker.</b> Knowing that the ring is more confortable for sleep tracking than smart watches, we have developed our sleep detection, sleep stages classification, nap detection algorithms. In addition, a sleep quality evaluation model is proposed in the APP. </li>
        <li><b>Health Trend.</b> Continous and accurate physiological indicator recording is vital for health-care systems and medical diagnosis. RingConn can monitor and record the indicators in every few minutes, which could be an important reference for doctor's diagnosis.</li>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Novel Chair Design</h2>
        2017-2019<br>
        My Ph.D. supervisor and I developed a smart chair to alleviate seat pressure for elderly individuals who spend extended periods of sitting time. The chair is equipped with a mat device to collect pressure distribution data from the seat surface, and electric extension/retraction mechanisms in the seat base redistribute pressure accordingly.

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Tunnel Inspection System</h2>
        2016<br>
        I played a pivotal role as the lead engineer in my Ph.D. supervisor’s project, which aimed to develop a comprehensive hardware and software system to inspect the condition of tunnels for MTR (HK). Our team successfully engineered a mechanical system capable of holding six cameras, which were strategically placed to capture 360-degree images of the tunnel. The cameras were controlled and synchronized by an embedded system to ensure optimal image overlapping. Additionally, we developed a software to assist engineers in examining the wall surface and equipment conditions of the tunnel.

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">ERP and Scheduling System</h2>
        2016-2017<br>
        I developed an ERP system for a traditional printing company in China with the objective of creating an automated order management and scheduling system. Our system involved implementing functionalities such as order reading, machine setting, AI scheduling, and task exporting. This software solution significantly improved the efficiency of scheduling, order completion rates, and overall intelligence level of the company’s operations.
