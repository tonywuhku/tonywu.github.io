        <h2 class="blog-post-title">RingConn: Smart Health Monitoring Ring</h2>
        July 2021 - Now <br>
        I am the CTO and co-founder of Guangdong Jiuzhi Technology Co., Ltd since establised in 2021. In Jiuzhi, I leads the techology & product department including six teams: product and project management, application development, hardware design, website development, algorithm implementation, and R&D research. <br>
        RingConn Smart Ring is the first commercial wearable device that our company has released. RingConn is developed as a world-class smart health monitoring ring, which is equipped by low-power electronic design, accurate algorithms, user-friendly application, and health-care system. All of the technologies are developed by our company, and we own the whole intellectual property. <br>
        We used 17 months to develop and manufacture the brand-new smart ring, and RingConn was firstly sold as a crowdfunding project in INDIEGOGO. Owning to the excellent product and customer services, we have sold more than 8,000 devices with a value above 1.2million USD in 50 days. <br>
        The key features of RingConn are introduced as follows. 
        <li><b>Health Indicators.</b> Based on the PPG sensors and accelerometers, we have implemented some key algorithms for physiological indicators, such as heart rate, heart rate variability, oxygen saturation, step counting, and respiratory rate. </li>
        <li><b>Sleep Tracker.</b> Knowing that the ring is more confortable for sleep tracking than smart watches, we have developed our sleep detection, sleep stages classification, nap detection algorithms. In addition, a sleep quality evaluation model is proposed in the APP. </li>
        <li><b>Health Trend.</b> Continous and accurate physiological indicator recording is vital for health-care systems and medical diagnosis. RingConn can monitor and record the indicators in every few minutes, which could be an important reference for doctor's diagnosis.</li>
